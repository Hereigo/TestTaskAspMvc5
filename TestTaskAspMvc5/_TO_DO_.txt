CREATE A NEW WEB APPLICATION (MVC 5)

There you need to create only one page (view) with 2 tabs (javascript in use)
First tab is defaulted. There you can generate n number of keys for a customer.
Second tab is the result view. Display there all the customers which were used and a list of unique numbers which were generated for each customer.

FIRST TAB:

html input = customer (id of a customer (you may put here any key))
html input = the number of new unique digits to be generated
html button = submit.
When you submit generate N amount of unique numbers and store them into database.
Keys should belong to a customer you entered (customer id). So basically when you enter a new customer Id, new keys will be assigned to that customer.
The length of a unique number must be unique and 16 digits long.

SECOND TAB:

A simple html table with one column or just <li> <ul>, etc. which has all the customers’ Ids.
When you click on one of them, there should be html container within the current tab which will load the list of keys belong to current clicked customer.

COMMUNICATE WITH SERVER ONLY VIA AJAX CALLS.

THE STATE OF THE OPEN TAB SHOULD BE PRE-SELECTED IF A BROWSER WAS CLOSED AND OPENED AGAIN.
